VIM config with IDE features to work on PHP projects (still in dev.)

Features
========
* Project explorer
* File outline
* Quick jump to methods, classes, functions...
* phpDocumentor to create phpDoc comments blocks quickly
* Comment/uncomment lines quickly
* (Don't be scared by the time it takes the first time you open a file, is gathering the project references and is only the first time) :)

Requirements
============
* Only tested with VIM 7.3 but is supposed to work with VIM 6 and higher

Install
=======
* sudo apt-get install vim exuberant-ctags
* Download the .zip file and copy .vimrc and .vim/ contents to your home directory or "git clone https://github.com/dmonllao/vim-php-ide.git" and move contents to ~/

Usage
=====
* cd /your/project/root
* vim the/file/you/want/to/open.php  (All PHP files in /your/project/root will be parsed to get the available tags)
* Jump to methods, classes or functions: Press \<CTRL + PageUp\> (to open horizontally) or \<CTRL + PageDown\> (to open vertically)
* Open a file from the project explorer: Press intro to open it in the main window, "s" to open it splitting the screen vertically or "i" to split it horizontally
* Navigate through windows \<CTRL + w\> and \<Up\>, \<Down\>, \<Left\> or \<Right\> depending on where is the window you want to focus
* Comment the current line: Press "\<leader\>cc" or "\<leader\>c\<space\>" to toogle the line comment (\<leader\> key is mapped to "\" by default)
* Check PHP syntax: Type ":make"
* To add phpDocs to a class, method or function: Go to the class/var/method/function definition line and press \<CTRL + P\>, you can overwrite the default values in ~/.vim/plugin/php-doc.vim
* To paste without indentation problems: Press \<Ins\> (Insert) key and CTRL+SHIFT+P
* To toggle the file outline: Press \<F8\>
* To toggle the project explorer: Press \<F7\>

Tips
